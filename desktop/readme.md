Converti Desktop is an Electron-based application for converting files between various formats. It features a React frontend, Electron main/preload processes, and uses Vite and Electron Builder.


## Architecture Overview

- **Electron Main Process**  
  Handles file conversion, archiving, dialogs, and system-level operations.  
  Location: [`electron/main/index.ts`](electron/main/index.ts)

- **Electron Preload Process**  
  Bridges secure communication between the renderer and main process.  
  Location: [`electron/preload/index.ts`](electron/preload/index.ts)

- **React Renderer (Frontend)**  
  User interface for uploading, converting, and managing files.  
  Location: [`src/`](src/)

- **Helpers & Utilities**  
  Conversion logic, file handling, and format support.  
  Location: [`electron/Helpers/`](electron/Helpers/)

- **Assets**  
  Icons, binaries, and static resources.  
  Location: [`assets/`](assets/)

## File Structure

- **Configuration**
  - [`vite.config.ts`](vite.config.ts): Vite build config
  - [`electron-builder.json`](electron-builder.json): Electron packaging config
  - [`package.json`](package.json): Dependencies and scripts

- **Main Electron Logic**
  - [`electron/main/index.ts`](electron/main/index.ts): Main process entry
  - [`electron/Helpers/`](electron/Helpers/): Conversion and archiving helpers

- **Frontend**
  - [`src/components/`](src/components/): React components (UI, logic)
  - [`src/App.tsx`](src/App.tsx): Main app component

- **Preload**
  - [`electron/preload/index.ts`](electron/preload/index.ts): Preload script

- **Assets**
  - [`assets/icons/`](assets/icons/): App icons
  - [`assets/bin/`](assets/bin/): Binaries for conversion

- **Public**
  - [`public/`](public/): Static files (favicon, images)

- **Release**
  - [`release/`](release/): Packaged builds

## How It Works

1. **User uploads files** via the React UI ([`src/components/Converter.tsx`](src/components/Converter.tsx)).
2. **File types are detected** and grouped.
3. **User selects output formats** or archive options.
4. **Conversion/archiving requests** are sent to Electron main via IPC.
5. **Main process** ([`electron/main/index.ts`](electron/main/index.ts)) uses helpers ([`electron/Helpers/`](electron/Helpers/)) to process files.
6. **Progress and logs** are sent back to the UI for display.
7. **Converted files** are saved to the chosen location.
